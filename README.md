it meant to be a project for c++ course and physics course for my Unvirsity "AAUP" .
# How to try it :
You can try the simulator either by building the code or by installing the prebuilt binaries from release page . 
*Release page : https://github.com/Obaidah-Jbreel/motion_simulation/releases/tag/c*
# How To build it : 
Building from source  : 
In order to build the codebase in your system you have to make sure you have the essential tools for building cmake projects .
